## Features
* View artists, songs, albums, playlists, favorite artists and albums, genres, similar albums and artists
* Queue: add songs and albums, reorder & delete songs, clear queue
* Control (and view) play state through Dbus integration
* Remote control over Jellyfin server. Currently implemented:
    * Play / pause / stop
    * Set volume
    * Next/previous track
* Supported formats (server transcodes everything else to mp3): mp3,ogg,flac,wav

## Building
**You will need Go 1.13 or Go 1.14 installed and configured**

* For additional audio libraries required, see [Hajimehoshi/oto](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/oto). 
On linux you need libasound2-dev.
* Currently jellycli has issues with Windows and is unable to start properly.

**Warning: for the time being, use git clone directly instead of go get.** There is an issue with dependency 
(rivo/tview) being automatically upgraded and causing deadlocks.

Download & build package
```
git clone https://github.com/tryffel/jellycli.git
cd jellycli
go build .
./jellycli
```

On first time application asks for Jellyfin host, username, password and default collection for music. 
All this is stored in configuration file at ~/.config/jellycli/jellycli.yaml. 
Configuration file location is visible in help page. 
You can use multiple config files by providing argument:
```
jellycli --config temp.yaml
```

Log file is located at '/tmp/jellycli.log' by default. This can be overridden with config file. 
At the moment jellycli does not inform user about errors but rather just silently logs them.
For development purposes you should set log-level either to debug or trace.
