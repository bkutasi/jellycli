# Jellycli

Terminal client for Jellyfin, mostly for music at the moment. This is very much work-in-progress.

## Building:
Assuming go installed:
```
go get -u tryffel.net/pkg/jellycli/cmd
# go to /cmd
go run .
```

On first time application asks for Jellyfin host, username, password and default collection for music. 
It stores all this information in OS wallet (tested only with KDE KWallet). After this, you should be able to 
browse your music and play it.
